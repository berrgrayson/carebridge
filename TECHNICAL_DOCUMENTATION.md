# CareBridge Technical Documentation

## System Architecture

### 1. Application Structure

CareBridge follows a modern Next.js 13+ application structure with the App Router pattern. The application is built using TypeScript for type safety and organized into several key directories:

```
carebridge/
├── app/                    # Next.js app directory (App Router)
├── components/            # Reusable React components
├── constants/             # Application constants and translations
├── lib/                   # Core utilities and configurations
├── public/               # Static assets
└── types/                # TypeScript type definitions
```

### 2. Core Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 13+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN/UI components
- **Backend**: Appwrite BaaS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Authentication**: Appwrite Authentication
- **Database**: Appwrite Database
- **File Storage**: Appwrite Storage
- **Notifications**: Twilio SMS Integration
- **Monitoring**: Sentry

## Application Flow

### 1. Initialization

1. **Application Bootstrap**

   - Next.js app initializes
   - Environment variables are loaded
   - Appwrite client is configured
   - Language context is initialized with default language

2. **Authentication Setup**
   - Appwrite authentication is initialized
   - Session management is configured
   - Protected routes are established

### 2. User Journey

#### Patient Flow

1. **Registration/Login**

   - User registers or logs in through Appwrite authentication
   - Profile information is stored in Appwrite database
   - Session token is generated and stored

2. **Appointment Management**
   - Patient views available time slots
   - Books appointment with preferred doctor
   - Receives confirmation via SMS
   - Can view and manage appointments

#### Admin Flow

1. **Dashboard Access**

   - Admin logs in with special credentials
   - Accesses comprehensive appointment dashboard
   - Views all patient appointments and statistics

2. **Appointment Handling**
   - Confirms or reschedules appointments
   - Manages cancellations
   - Updates appointment status
   - Sends notifications to patients

### 3. Data Management

#### Database Structure

1. **Collections**

   - Patients Collection
   - Appointments Collection
   - Doctors Collection
   - User Profiles Collection

2. **Relationships**
   - Appointments linked to Patients and Doctors
   - User Profiles linked to Authentication

#### File Storage

- Medical documents stored in Appwrite Storage
- Secure access control for patient files
- Efficient retrieval system

### 4. Multilingual Support

1. **Language Management**

   - LanguageContext provider wraps the application
   - Translations stored in structured JSON files
   - Dynamic language switching without page reload

2. **Translation Implementation**
   - Separate translation files for each language
   - Organized by feature categories
   - Consistent key structure across languages

### 5. Real-time Updates

1. **Data Refresh Mechanism**

   - Callback-based refresh system
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **State Management**
   - React Context for global state
   - Local state for component-specific data
   - Efficient re-rendering optimization

## Security Measures

### 1. Authentication Security

- Secure session management
- Protected route middleware
- Role-based access control

### 2. Data Security

- Encrypted data storage
- Secure file upload/download
- Data access permissions

### 3. API Security

- Authenticated API routes
- Rate limiting
- Request validation

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Frontend Optimization

- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Lazy loading
- Caching strategies

### 2. Backend Optimization

- Efficient database queries
- Optimized file storage
- Request batching

### 3. Monitoring

- Sentry error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
